  <p>#Opinion, Magento 2 or Magento 1?</p>

<p>Is it really worth to deliver a project based on Magento 2 in this current state of development?</p>

<p><strong>For the company I work for, mostly no.</strong></p>

<h3 id="magento-2-is-wonderful-but-still-under-massive-changes-and-improvements">Magento 2 is wonderful, but still under massive changes and improvements</h3>
<p>It’s january 2017 and more than year has already passed sincce Magento 2 officiale release.
As a web developer used to rely on opensource projects, I really appreciate the efforts that every community puts in place to make a platform really great and I aslo understand the difficulties a new release may have to walk thorugh.</p>

<p><strong>The community edition of Magento 2 has a huge number of open issues</strong> and in the past days I read comments on github and <a href="http://webshopapps.com/blog/2017/01/what-magento-should-spend-some-of-that-250m-on/" title="What Magento Should spend some of that 250M on">a post by a gold partner</a> that make you seriously think twice before starting a project to the world.</p>

<p>Two months ago I also started my official and planned study of the new platform. Currently half way to the end of the course, I find <strong>Magento has completely changed from the version 1</strong>.</p>

<p>There is a <strong>massive difference</strong> between very small company applications and big enterprises solutions. Magento 1, somehow, represents a solutions that can address the online needs of a small shop and can scale up to big projects where computational requirements can be split across different servers.</p>

<h3 id="for-big-companies">For big companies</h3>
<p>Magento 2 seem to have completely forgotten the really small business and becomes the best ecommerce platform only in the hands of a big company, with a structured web development department.</p>

<p>The small developer, and the medium company, have to set aside their desires of “fast and different projects” and think instead on a bigger scale. Plan ahead the development, its required test phases, and plan ahead the adoption of technologies, frameworks and assets that may speed up any possible process.</p>

<h3 id="fast-on-big-implementations">Fast on big implementations</h3>
<p>I read about people complaining about Magento 2 speed. On a development environment is slow. I complain about it too. But the more I study, and through the experience I gathered with the amazing <strong>php framework Laravel</strong>, and the more I realise Magento 2 development requires me to change my way of coding.</p>

<p>No more, tweaks, test, tweak, test, works, refactor, test, go. 
Will have to be more a think, design, think, check, think, adjust and finally test. More observations, reasoning, and lesstime wasted in coding.</p>

<p>As I read on <a href="http://jamescowie.me/blog/2016/12/all-hail-xdebug-and-lets-let-var-dump-die/" title="James Cowie's Magento 2 blog - All hail Xdebug and lets let var dump die">James Cowie blog</a>, it’s time to abandon var_dump/die in favor of xdebug for a better way of coding.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-magento-2-ready-to-begin-a-project">is it Magento 2 ready to begin a project?</h3>
<p>Yes, but if you plan to avoid a proper coding environment without tools for tests automation, debugging, tasks automation (I read grunt is the fastest at the minute), css compilation, deployment automation, you should wait another 6 months longer before beginning to work on Magento 2.</p>
