  <p>#Magento 2 devbox - Docker quick start guide</p>

<p><strong>[this document is a work in progess]</strong></p>

<p>This guide, was tried on macOS SIERRA where Docker was already installed.
A brief introduction about Docker. Docker is a virtualization environment where you will use one or more images be fired up into “containers” and use only those bits of environment you will need for your work.
So, you can expect to fire up an httpd (apache) container with no shell access at all.</p>

<p>Here the steps to run the environment.</p>

<p>1 <strong>Clone the git repository</strong>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/magento/magento2devbox-web.git</code></p>

<p>2 <strong>Move into the folder</strong></p>

<p>3 <strong>Compile our custom image</strong> (expect it to take while…)
<code class="highlighter-rouge">docker build -t magento2devbox ./</code>
you will see Docker downloading a bunch of “docker containers” to compile them all into one customised image.</p>

<p>You will now have a new image, ready to be fired into a container. You can check the new images has been created with:</p>

  <p>#Opinion, Magento 2 or Magento 1?</p>

<p>Is it really worth to deliver a project based on Magento 2 in this current state of development?</p>

<p><img src="images/blog.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>For the company I work for, mostly no.</strong></p>

<h3 id="magento-2-is-wonderful-but-still-under-massive-changes-and-improvements">Magento 2 is wonderful, but still under massive changes and improvements</h3>
<p>It’s january 2017 and more than year has already passed sincce Magento 2 officiale release.
As a web developer used to rely on opensource projects, I really appreciate the efforts that every community puts in place to make a platform really great and I aslo understand the difficulties a new release may have to walk thorugh.</p>

<p><strong>The community edition of Magento 2 has a huge number of open issues</strong> and in the past days I read comments on github and <a href="http://webshopapps.com/blog/2017/01/what-magento-should-spend-some-of-that-250m-on/" title="What Magento Should spend some of that 250M on">a post by a gold partner</a> that make you seriously think twice before starting a project to the world.</p>

<p>Two months ago I also started my official and planned study of the new platform. Currently half way to the end of the course, I find <strong>Magento has completely changed from the version 1</strong>.</p>

<p>There is a <strong>massive difference</strong> between very small company applications and big enterprises solutions. Magento 1, somehow, represents a solutions that can address the online needs of a small shop and can scale up to big projects where computational requirements can be split across different servers.</p>

<h3 id="for-big-companies">For big companies</h3>
<p>Magento 2 seem to have completely forgotten the really small business and becomes the best ecommerce platform only in the hands of a big company, with a structured web development department.</p>

<p>The small developer, and the medium company, have to set aside their desires of “fast and different projects” and think instead on a bigger scale. Plan ahead the development, its required test phases, and plan ahead the adoption of technologies, frameworks and assets that may speed up any possible process.</p>

<h3 id="fast-on-big-implementations">Fast on big implementations</h3>
<p>I read about people complaining about Magento 2 speed. On a development environment is slow. I complain about it too. But the more I study, and through the experience I gathered with the amazing <strong>php framework Laravel</strong>, and the more I realise Magento 2 development requires me to change my way of coding.</p>

<p>No more, tweaks, test, tweak, test, works, refactor, test, go. 
Will have to be more a think, design, think, check, think, adjust and finally test. More observations, reasoning, and lesstime wasted in coding.</p>

<p>As I read on <a href="http://jamescowie.me/blog/2016/12/all-hail-xdebug-and-lets-let-var-dump-die/" title="James Cowie's Magento 2 blog - All hail Xdebug and lets let var dump die">James Cowie blog</a>, it’s time to abandon var_dump/die in favor of xdebug for a better way of coding.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-magento-2-ready-to-begin-a-project">is it Magento 2 ready to begin a project?</h3>
<p>Yes, but if you plan to avoid a proper coding environment without tools for tests automation, debugging, tasks automation (I read grunt is the fastest at the minute), css compilation, deployment automation, you should wait another 6 months longer before beginning to work on Magento 2.</p>
