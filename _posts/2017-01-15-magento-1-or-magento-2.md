Is it really worth to deliver a project based on Magento 2 in this current state of development?

**For the company I work for, mostly no.**


### Magento 2 is wonderful, but still under massive changes and improvements
It's january 2017 and more than year has already passed sincce Magento 2 officiale release.
As a web developer used to rely on opensource projects, I really appreciate the efforts that every community puts in place to make a platform really great and I aslo understand the difficulties a new release may have to walk thorugh.

**The community edition of Magento 2 has a huge number of open issues** and in the past days I read comments on github and [a post by a gold partner](http://webshopapps.com/blog/2017/01/what-magento-should-spend-some-of-that-250m-on/ "What Magento Should spend some of that 250M on") that make you seriously think twice before starting a project to the world.

Two months ago I also started my official and planned study of the new platform. Currently half way to the end of the course, I find **Magento has completely changed from the version 1**.

There is a **massive difference** between very small company applications and big enterprises solutions. Magento 1, somehow, represents a solutions that can address the online needs of a small shop and can scale up to big projects where computational requirements can be split across different servers.


### For big companies
Magento 2 seem to have completely forgotten the really small business and becomes the best ecommerce platform only in the hands of a big company, with a structured web development department.

The small developer, and the medium company, have to set aside their desires of "fast and different projects" and think instead on a bigger scale. Plan ahead the development, its required test phases, and plan ahead the adoption of technologies, frameworks and assets that may speed up any possible process.


### Fast on big implementations
I read about people complaining about Magento 2 speed. On a development environment is slow. I complain about it too. But the more I study, and through the experience I gathered with the amazing **php framework Laravel**, and the more I realise Magento 2 development requires me to change my way of coding.

No more, tweaks, test, tweak, test, works, refactor, test, go. 
Will have to be more a think, design, think, check, think, adjust and finally test. More observations, reasoning, and lesstime wasted in coding.

As I read on [James Cowie blog](http://jamescowie.me/blog/2016/12/all-hail-xdebug-and-lets-let-var-dump-die/ "James Cowie's Magento 2 blog - All hail Xdebug and lets let var dump die"), it's time to abandon var_dump/die in favor of xdebug for a better way of coding.


### is it Magento 2 ready to begin a project? 
Yes, but if you plan to avoid a proper coding environment without tools for tests automation, debugging, tasks automation (I read grunt is the fastest at the minute), css compilation, deployment automation, you should wait another 6 months longer before beginning to work on Magento 2.
